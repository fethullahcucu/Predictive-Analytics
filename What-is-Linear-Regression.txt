What is Linear Regression ? 
Linear regression is a simple and widely used statistical method for modeling the relationship between a 
dependent variable (target) and one or more independent variables (features). It assumes a linear relationship 
between the independent variables and the dependent variable, represented by a straight line equation.

The formula is : y = b + m1 * x1 + m2 * x2 + ... + mn * xn
-y is the dependent variable (the target variable you want to predict).
-x1, x2, ... are the independent variables (features) in your dataset.
-m1, m2, ... are the coefficients (also known as weights) associated with each of the independent variables. 
They represent the change in y for a unit change in each respective.
-b is the y-intercept, representing the value of y when all the independent variables (x1, x2, ..., xn) are zero.

What kind of cases we can Linear Regression?

1. House Price Prediction:
Case: Suppose you have a dataset containing information about houses, such as the number of bedrooms, 
square footage, and location. You want to predict the price of a house based on these features.

Example: You can use linear regression to build a predictive model that takes the features (number of bedrooms, 
square footage, etc.) as inputs and predicts the house price as the output.

2. Sales Forecasting:
Case: Imagine you have historical sales data for a retail store, including factors like advertising spending, 
previous sales, and seasonality. You want to forecast future sales based on these variables.

Example: Linear regression can be used to create a model that predicts future sales by taking advertising spending, 
previous sales figures, and other relevant factors into account.
